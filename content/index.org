I am Assistant Professor (RTD/B) of Italian Literature at the DIRAAS (Department
of Italian Studies, Romance Studies, Ancient Studies, Arts, and Entertainment)
of the University of Genoa. In 2020-2021 I was /Premier Assistant/ at the
/Section d’Italien/ of the University of Lausanne, and holder of the Praloran
Fellowship (Fondazione Ezio Franceschini – Florence / University of Lausanne).
In 2018-2020 I was Research Fellow at the University of Modena and Reggio
Emilia. I have also taught courses at the Universities of Pisa and Bologna.

My research activity has concentrated on the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries,
with my main focus on the Italian /Seicento/. Recently, it has delved into the
works of Federico De Roberto (1861-1927) and their connections with /fin de
siècle/ positivist culture.
